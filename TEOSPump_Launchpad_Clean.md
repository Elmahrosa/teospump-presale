# üõ†Ô∏è TEOSPump Launchpad Integration Plan

## üéØ Objective
Enhance TeosPump with a streamlined, no-code-style presale flow while maintaining self-hosted and brand-controlled operations.

---

## 1. Pre-sale Workflow (4-Step)

### ‚úÖ Select Token & Payment
- Users can choose $TEOS and pay with SOL or USDC.
- Define pricing, minimum/maximum purchase limits, and optional whitelist.

### ‚úÖ Whitelist Phase
- Provide early access with special pricing/limits.
- Manage distinct periods for whitelist and public sale.

### ‚úÖ Sale Details & Branding
- Add sale name, description, logo, tokenomics, and social links.

### ‚úÖ Review & Launch
- Confirm settings, initiate sale, and open the smart contract.
- Collect funds and create liquidity pool (LP) at the specified launch price.

---

## 2. Smart Contract & Backend
- Develop a Launchpad model using Solana's capabilities.
- Features: sale windows, soft/hard caps, vesting, and handling of leftover tokens.
- Implement necessary endpoints:
  - `/api/presale/init`
  - `/api/presale/buy`
  - `/api/presale/claim`
- Utilize the existing Express backend to connect to Solana via `@solana/web3.js`.

---

## 3. Frontend Enhancements
- Create a multi-step user interface in Next.js:
  - Step 1: Token and payment selector.
  - Step 2: Whitelist registration (if enabled).
  - Step 3: Sale branding form.
  - Step 4: Launch countdown and status display.
- Post-launch features:
  - "Buy $TEOS" button with real-time interaction.
  - Vesting and claimable token section.

---

## 4. Liquidity & Anti-Bot Features
- Automatically create LP using a Solana DEX aggregator (e.g., Raydium/OpenBook) upon launch.
- Implement anti-bot measures to ensure fair participation.

---

## 5. Airdrop & Claim Sites
- Develop an Airdrop Claim landing page:
  - Accept wallet input.
  - Verify whitelist inclusion.
  - Allow claims with transactions locked via the UI.

---

## 6. Admin Dashboard
- Monitor sale stages: initialization, whitelist, live, and finalization.
- Display analytics: current funds, progress vs. caps, and supply sold.
- Enable manual fund withdrawal and LP creation steps.

---

## 7. Integration with Existing TeosPump Flow
- Maintain TeosPump‚Äôs unique branding and multi-tiered airdrop features.
- Use the enhanced buy/claim page as the primary presale flow.
- Ensure compatibility with existing TeosPump features.
